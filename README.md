## Package versioning

In this repository, the charts follow this versioning X.Y.P 
X.Y.Z is the upstream chart's major.minor.patch.

The X.Y.P versioning scheme roughly corresponds to the following rules (with exceptions):
- **Major Version**: represents the minor version these charts are being released to.
- **Minor Version**: represents a release line of a given chart within a minor version. Functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **Patch Version**: represents a patch to a given release line of a chart within a minor version. Make backward compatible bug fixes
